# Google Chrome Minesweeper Solver Extension
I'm going to try to make a chrome extension that will automatically solve google minesweeper. Why? Why not.

This project is not finished. I plan on first implementing the solver in minesweeper online as tile data is significantly easier to access there.

To do:
* Accounting for square size differences in different difficulties
* Number detection of squares
* Implent the actual solver
